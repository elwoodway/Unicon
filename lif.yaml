              equity_recommendations: There should only be one language for a competency
                and for a framework, but the same framework could be copied and defined
                in a different language, but that copy  would have unique Ids. Do
                not overlook this when using this element.

                \ address, be it personal, home, work etc., can have significant equity\
                \ implications, particularly concerning privacy, security, and socioeconomic\
                \ disparities and especially for people from marginalized communities.\n\
                \nLIF implementors need to be responsible in the ways we design and\
                \ use data models to serve in the use and transformation of peoples\
                \ address data, requiring a holistic approach that acknowledges the\
                \ historical injustices in the use of address data.\n\nIt is important\
                \ we center the discussion of address in the history of how address\
                \ data and information in the USA on where people live reside are\
                \ from and their address status (e.g., nonresident, resident, people\
                \ experiencing homeless) has been for centuries and still is used\
                \ against people, especially indigenous communities (i.e., displacement,\
                \ forced relocation), people from black and immigrant communities\
                \ (e.g., redlining, economic disparities), homeless, and refugee communities.\
                \ The treatment and use of this data has resulted in limiting people's\
                \ access to safety and security, as well as learning, work and financial\
                \ opportunities continuing systemic marginalization based on address\
                \ and location data and information.\n\nConsiderations around address\
                \ for indigenous and first nations peoples\n1. Throughout history,\
                \ Indigenous and first nations peoples in the USA have faced forced\
                \ relocation from their ancestral lands, often to reservations or\
                \ urban areas. Using or treating data on their addresses can serve\
                \ as a reminder of this history of displacement and the ongoing impacts\
                \ on Indigenous communities' access to resources and services.\n2.\
                \ Indigenous communities have voiced concerns about the collection\
                \ and use of their address data by external entities without their\
                \ consent or meaningful participation. Address data collection efforts\
                \ must respect Indigenous principles of data sovereignty, self-determination,\
                \ and privacy, and involve community engagement.\n3. Address data\
                \ collected from Indigenous communities may be vulnerable to misuse\
                \ or discriminatory practices, such as racial profiling by law enforcement\
                \ or targeting by predatory vendors and service providers. Ensuring\
                \ the ethical and responsible use of address data is essential to\
                \ prevent further harm and uphold principles of equity and justice.\n\
                \nConsiderations around address for people experiencing homelessness\n\
                \ - Historically, people experiencing homelessness have been stigmatized\
                \ and marginalized, facing discrimination in housing, employment,\
                \ and access to services. Collecting data on their addresses can perpetuate\
                \ this stigma and potentially expose them to further discrimination\
                \ or harassment.\n- Homeless individuals may have legitimate concerns\
                \ about the privacy and safety of their personal information, including\
                \ their addresses. Collecting data on their addresses without adequate\
                \ safeguards or assurances of confidentiality can further erode their\
                \ trust in institutions and discourage them from seeking assistance\
                \ or support services.\n- Someone who is experiencing homelessness\
                \ should have the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in a manner\
                \ that is accessible, without having to provide an address or other\
                \ identifying information, and be able to benefit from LIF in order\
                \ to help to improve their life circumstances.\n\nConsiderations around\
                \ address for people from black and immigrant communities\n- Historically,\
                \ Black communities have been subject to discriminatory housing practices,\
                \ including redlining, which systematically denied access to mortgage\
                \ loans and homeownership opportunities based on race. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within these communities may reflect the legacy\
                \ of segregation and economic disenfranchisement, perpetuating disparities\
                \ in wealth, housing quality, and access to resources.\n- Immigrant\
                \ communities, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, have\
                \ faced discriminatory policies and practices that restrict their\
                \ access to housing, employment, education, and healthcare. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within immigrant communities may expose individuals\
                \ and families to heightened surveillance, immigration enforcement,\
                \ and xenophobic attacks, contributing to feelings of insecurity and\
                \ fear.\n- Black and immigrant communities are disproportionately\
                \ targeted for surveillance, policing, and criminalization. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within these communities may facilitate racial\
                \ profiling, discriminatory policing practices, and surveillance technologies,\
                \ leading to harassment, violence, and incarceration.\n\nGeneral considerations\
                \ and recommendations\n- Considering the foundational premise of LIF\
                \ is intended to serve people from marginalized and underrepresented\
                \ communities, it is important to recognize that sharing a street\
                \ address can be sensitive for some people, dignity, respect and compassion\
                \ should be priority.\n- That address is optional, and not required\
                \ for a learner to be able to benefit from LIF.\n- That the format\
                \ for address adopts a generic international address format, i.e,\
                \ not US centric to allow for multiple address formats.\n -That people\
                \ can consent to the use and treatment of address in a manner that\
                \ is best suited to them, and choosing to not include an address should\
                \ not preclude a learner from being able to benefit from LIF.\n- If\
                \ used for research purposes, an explanation about how address will\
                \ be used, in an accessible manner, and informed manner."

              equity_recommendations: "|-\nUsing and treating data on someone's physical\
                \ address, be it personal, home, work etc., can have significant equity\
                \ implications, particularly concerning privacy, security, and socioeconomic\
                \ disparities and especially for people from marginalized communities.\n\
                \nLIF implementors need to be responsible in the ways we design and\
                \ use data models to serve in the use and transformation of peoples\
                \ address data, requiring a holistic approach that acknowledges the\
                \ historical injustices in the use of address data.\n\nIt is important\
                \ we center the discussion of address in the history of how address\
                \ data and information in the USA on where people live reside are\
                \ from and their address status (e.g., nonresident, resident, people\
                \ experiencing homeless) has been for centuries and still is used\
                \ against people, especially indigenous communities (i.e., displacement,\
                \ forced relocation), people from black and immigrant communities\
                \ (e.g., redlining, economic disparities), homeless, and refugee communities.\
                \ The treatment and use of this data has resulted in limiting people's\
                \ access to safety and security, as well as learning, work and financial\
                \ opportunities continuing systemic marginalization based on address\
                \ and location data and information.\n\nConsiderations around address\
                \ for indigenous and first nations peoples\n1. Throughout history,\
                \ Indigenous and first nations peoples in the USA have faced forced\
                \ relocation from their ancestral lands, often to reservations or\
                \ urban areas. Using or treating data on their addresses can serve\
                \ as a reminder of this history of displacement and the ongoing impacts\
                \ on Indigenous communities' access to resources and services.\n2.\
                \ Indigenous communities have voiced concerns about the collection\
                \ and use of their address data by external entities without their\
                \ consent or meaningful participation. Address data collection efforts\
                \ must respect Indigenous principles of data sovereignty, self-determination,\
                \ and privacy, and involve community engagement.\n3. Address data\
                \ collected from Indigenous communities may be vulnerable to misuse\
                \ or discriminatory practices, such as racial profiling by law enforcement\
                \ or targeting by predatory vendors and service providers. Ensuring\
                \ the ethical and responsible use of address data is essential to\
                \ prevent further harm and uphold principles of equity and justice.\n\
                \nConsiderations around address for people experiencing homelessness\n\
                \ - Historically, people experiencing homelessness have been stigmatized\
                \ and marginalized, facing discrimination in housing, employment,\
                \ and access to services. Collecting data on their addresses can perpetuate\
                \ this stigma and potentially expose them to further discrimination\
                \ or harassment.\n- Homeless individuals may have legitimate concerns\
                \ about the privacy and safety of their personal information, including\
                \ their addresses. Collecting data on their addresses without adequate\
                \ safeguards or assurances of confidentiality can further erode their\
                \ trust in institutions and discourage them from seeking assistance\
                \ or support services.\n- Someone who is experiencing homelessness\
                \ should have the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in a manner\
                \ that is accessible, without having to provide an address or other\
                \ identifying information, and be able to benefit from LIF in order\
                \ to help to improve their life circumstances.\n\nConsiderations around\
                \ address for people from black and immigrant communities\n- Historically,\
                \ Black communities have been subject to discriminatory housing practices,\
                \ including redlining, which systematically denied access to mortgage\
                \ loans and homeownership opportunities based on race. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within these communities may reflect the legacy\
                \ of segregation and economic disenfranchisement, perpetuating disparities\
                \ in wealth, housing quality, and access to resources.\n- Immigrant\
                \ communities, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, have\
                \ faced discriminatory policies and practices that restrict their\
                \ access to housing, employment, education, and healthcare. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within immigrant communities may expose individuals\
                \ and families to heightened surveillance, immigration enforcement,\
                \ and xenophobic attacks, contributing to feelings of insecurity and\
                \ fear.\n- Black and immigrant communities are disproportionately\
                \ targeted for surveillance, policing, and criminalization. Collecting\
                \ data on addresses within these communities may facilitate racial\
                \ profiling, discriminatory policing practices, and surveillance technologies,\
                \ leading to harassment, violence, and incarceration.\n\nGeneral considerations\
                \ and recommendations\n- Considering the foundational premise of LIF\
                \ is intended to serve people from marginalized and underrepresented\
                \ communities, it is important to recognize that sharing a street\
                \ address can be sensitive for some people, dignity, respect and compassion\
                \ should be priority.\n- That address is optional, and not required\
                \ for a learner to be able to benefit from LIF.\n- That the format\
                \ for address adopts a generic international address format, i.e,\
                \ not US centric to allow for multiple address formats.\n -That people\
                \ can consent to the use and treatment of address in a manner that\
                \ is best suited to them, and choosing to not include an address should\
                \ not preclude a learner from being able to benefit from LIF.\n- If\
                \ used for research purposes, an explanation about how address will\
                \ be used, in an accessible manner, and informed manner."

            In the treatment of a person name by the Learner Information Framework
            (LIF) and associated technologies, may users of LIF always center the
            human story of a person''s name, how important it is to them, its cultural
            connectedness to people and land, how people traverse multiple ways of
            naming and the impact of naming on our stories, experiences and the opportunities
            it may connect (or disconnect) us to/from.   Using and treating data on
            people''s names can raise several equity issues due to the diversity of
            naming conventions across cultures and ethnicities. Some of these equity
            issues include

            1. Many of the data standards from which LIF draws its normative data
            model, and as to user of LIF, these systems are designed with Western
            naming conventions in mind, which can marginalize individuals with non-Western
            names. This bias can lead to inaccuracies in data analysis and decision-making
            processes. For example, we made recommendations for the separation of
            name and name type as well as inclusion of multiple characters, unlimited
            character length, etc).

            2. The variety of ways the standards treat person name shows limited interoperability
            between system-standards, which ultimately may lead to multiple records
            with different ways names are recorded, managed, and/or used. This Inaccurate
            or incomplete data due to mishandling of names can lead to biased analyses
            and decision-making, ultimately reinforcing existing disparities in society.

            3. Many of the standards, and the normative model, collapse name and name
            type into each other. Given the sensitivities and human implications for
            name changes, as well as the type of name (e.g., preferred, legal, given/gifted
            etc), we leant into AACRAO report on student identity for recommendations
            on how learners/students prefer to record and include their names.

            4. Most of the standards systems encourage the standardization of names,
            which can overlook variations in spelling, pronunciation, and order of
            names across different cultures. This can result in the erasure of cultural
            identities and misrepresentation of individuals.

            5. Most of the standards did not include an option for people from indigenous
            communities to record their Nation Tribe, or their name type as belong
            to their nation tribe. We leaned into research from the BIA.gov and recommend
            adding this to the normative model to improve inclusivity and cultural
            responsiveness to the naming conventions of our first nations peoples.

            6. Collecting full names without proper consent or understanding of cultural
            sensitivities can infringe on individuals'' privacy rights, especially
            in contexts where certain names may carry social or political implications.
            For example, having strict guardrails on when/how legal name vs. preferred
            name is used and who has access to the


            For LIF purposes, our recommendation is that IF used in normative model,
            only names which have been consented to including/use by LIF, be included,
            with flexibility for their design and formatting to allow for cultural
            differences.


            Title Suffix and prefix components of a persons name are used to provide
            additional information about a person''s name. Using and treating data
            on people''s titles can raise several equity issues.

            1. One argument for the inclusion of titles in normative data models is
            they may provide contextual information about an individual''s identity
            and social status, and when used correctly, may ensure that individuals
            are addressed and identified appropriately, respects their social and
            professional distinctions.

            2. Traditional titles and honorifics often assume binary gender categories
            and may not adequately reflect the diversity of gender or social identities,
            may not be universally understood or used in all cultures or communities;
            and standardized forms may not accommodate all cultural or social variations
            in naming practices. For example, Mr. for men and Mrs. for married women.
            These assumptions about gender roles or marital status based on titles
            may not align with individuals'' cultural norms or preferences. This binary
            classification can exclude and do harm to individuals who do not identify
            within these categories, such as non-binary or gender non-conforming individuals.

            3. Name suffixes, such as Jr. or III, can sometimes reveal familial relationships
            or generational information. Collecting this data without consent or proper
            safeguards may infringe on individuals'' privacy rights and expose them
            to risks like identity theft or targeted advertising.

            4. Name suffixes may intersect with other aspects of an individual''s
            identity, such as race, ethnicity, or gender. Failing to consider these
            intersections can perpetuate systemic inequalities and hinder efforts
            to promote equity and social justice.

            5. Different cultures may have specific titles or honorifics that hold
            significance and should be respected in data collection processes. Failing
            to accommodate these cultural variations can lead to erasure and marginalization
            of certain communities.

            6. Further, some individuals may not use titles, prefixes, or suffixes
            at all in their names, or they may have unconventional naming customs
            that are not recognized by standardized systems.

            6. Inaccurate or incomplete data on titles and prefixes can lead to biased
            analyses and decision-making, especially in contexts such as healthcare
            or academic research where precise demographic information is crucial.

            7. Failing to accommodate these variations of the use of titles, suffix,
            and/or prefix can marginalize certain groups and perpetuate cultural biases.


            For LIF purposes, our recommendation is that if used in normative model,
            only titles, prefix and affix which have been consented to including/use,
            and which pertain to qualifications, credentials, work, learning, cultural
            significance and/or honorifics be included, with flexibility for their
            design and formatting to allow for cultural differences. Titles, prefix
            and suffix which pertain to social, generational, marital or gender status
            should not be included to not perpetuate inequalities and expose learner
            to harm.'
